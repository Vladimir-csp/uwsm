UUCTL(1)

# NAME

*uuctl* - Menu for controlling systemd user units.

# SYNOPSIS

*uuctl* [-ah] [_menu_] [_menu args_ ...]

# DESCRIPTION

Utilizing one of dmenu-like apps, presents a menu of user units, then actions
to be performed on the selected one.

Supported actions inclue standard systemctl actions (applicabilty may vary with
different units): start, reload, restart, stop, kill, reset-failed, enable,
disable, freeze, thaw, mask, unmask.

There are also custom actions: silence, unsilence. These can be used to modify
unit's logging behavior by selectively suppressing stdout or stderr writing to
journal.

If daemon reload action is detected to be needed, it would be suggested before
unit selection.

# MENU

Suported menu apps:

- walker
- fuzzel
- wofi
- rofi
- tofi
- bemenu
- wmenu
- dmenu

Menu app is autoselected, but can be specified manually as a single argument.

If more arguments are given, they are used as full menu command line, so
a custom menu command not limited to the predefined list may be given.
The last argument is expected to be a prompt option (-p or analogous).
